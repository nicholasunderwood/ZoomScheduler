# ZoomScheduler
This app uses the windows task manager to automatically launch zoom urls. The UI is designed to work with the BHS Term Schedule.

## Installation
To download the latest release, [click here](https://github.com/nicholasunderwood/ZoomScheduler/releases/download/0.3.0/Zoom.Scheduler.Setup.exe).
Both Chrome and Windows will flag the installer as virus. This is not true (I promise).
To interface with the task manager, the app needs permissions to launch shell scripts, which windows is justifiably wary about.

On Chrome, click the dropdown menu and press **keep**.\
On Windows, click **more info** and then **Install Anyway**.


## Usage
![alt text](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1tzFXXqTkWxPkG08ugCcY537v1ONUmG_4)

You can specify when and on what days of the week a meeting launches, as well as launching a meeting directly from the app.
After you've changed the settings, click the **Save** button to save your meeting information and create the scheduled tasks

If your teacher doesn't provide a link, you can use the **Use Meeting ID** option, which will launch a meeting without a password and copy the provided password to your clipboard.

You can click on the term headers to collapse them, and disabling a meeting will callapse it.
